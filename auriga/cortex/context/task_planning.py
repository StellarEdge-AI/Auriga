PLANNING_INSTRUCTIONS = """Before your first physical action, use the initial RGB and measured robot state
to understand the task. You may first observe, inspect geometry, retrieve relevant
experience or preview motions; these do not advance the world. Then submit an
ordinary-language task_plan. Keep it brief; useful headings are Task understanding
(the task, scene and uncertain assumptions) and Approach + completion (rough order
and visible completion evidence). For an unknown demonstration, plan to observe it
before choosing later actions. Waiting advances simulation and needs this plan too.
When planning, record the few concerns that matter now in attention: concern is a
question, unresolved prerequisite or choice; check is the expected visible evidence
and how to adjust if it disagrees or never appears; when is before work that relies
on it. Leave it empty when none apply. If a material task-result prerequisite is
unresolved and a later decision depends on it, keep one to three short ledger
rows for the expected event, current permitted basis and next distinguishing check.
Every initial task_plan submission must include ledger explicitly: use ledger: [] when
no material prerequisite is unresolved. On updates, omit ledger only when it is unchanged;
include the replacement ledger whenever an entry's expected, status, basis or next_check changes.
Select relevant experience without filling every row or inventing geometry.
Keep unresolved concerns that still affect the task. Revise or remove them when
evidence resolves them, a stated reinterpretation corrects the earlier judgment,
or they no longer matter; briefly record that basis in ordinary prose. Reusing the
same observation is valid when correcting an interpretation, not proof the world changed.
The Harness preserves the current saved plan, attention and ledger when context is
compacted. Reassess them against fresh feedback; saved judgments are not evidence.
Prefer evidence from the final observation of normal task-progress actions. Add a
separate probe only when missing evidence affects the next decision.
The task plan is provisional understanding, not an executable script. Adapt your
actions freely. After evidence contradicts a ledger row, change the contact, route
or target mechanism, or state that no distinguishing next step is supported;
rewriting the same hypothesis is not a strategy change. Before repeating an ineffective physical pattern, briefly state
a cause hypothesis and the observation or changed strategy that can distinguish
it. A short decision and its evidence are enough; no lengthy reasoning narration
is needed. When task understanding, object roles or the approach changes, update
plan and any affected attention together; attention-only updates leave plan unchanged.
For local concerns, update only attention. Neither needs rewriting after every motion. Concrete
targets, arm timing and gripper commands belong in robot_action.
Submit requires plan and an explicit ledger (possibly []); update can change plan, attention, ledger or any combination;
omitted fields are retained and [] clears a list. Ledger entries are short, advisory
evidence boundaries, not action gates: do not add a probe only to satisfy the ledger.
Submit/update returns a short acknowledgement; read retrieves the stored plan,
attention and ledger entries."""
