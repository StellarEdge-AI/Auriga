# Documentation Index

If you are new to Auriga, start with the main [README](../README.md) ([English](../README.md) / [简体中文](../README.zh-CN.md)) and the [Auriga Technical Report (PDF)](Auriga-Technical-Report.pdf).

The tables below organize all documentation by topic. Development rules and architectural boundaries are governed by [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), while the authoritative runtime tool contracts live in [`auriga/runtime/tools/definitions.py`](../auriga/runtime/tools/definitions.py) and [`auriga/runtime/tools/builtins.py`](../auriga/runtime/tools/builtins.py).

## 📐 Historical & Foundational Design Specifications

The documents in `docs/design/` preserve the foundational architecture specifications. Where early design drafts mention standalone motion tools, templates, skills, or `scene_*` tool names, the current implementation has converged onto the unified `robot_action` and program review interface described above.

| Document | Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Embodied Harness Design](design/embodied-harness-design.md) | Core philosophy, division of labor between the model and executor, observation boundaries, programs, and long-term roadmap. |
| [Shared Interface & Event Protocol](design/shared-protocol.md) | Run and action identities, `ObservationBundle`, `EEAction`, event streams, snapshots, and media references. |
| [Web Workbench & Codex Integration](design/web-workbench-and-codex.md) | Coupling native Codex sessions, PTY terminals, multi-camera robot views, and phase-synchronized history inspection. |
| [Local Scene & Short-Horizon Rollout](design/local-scene-and-rollout.md) | Constructing queryable 3D scenes and snapshots from permitted observations (full physical rollout worker remains future work). |

> [!NOTE]
> The live Cortex tool catalogue and input validation are assembled from [`auriga/runtime/tools/builtins.py`](../auriga/runtime/tools/builtins.py) and [`auriga/runtime/tools/definitions.py`](../auriga/runtime/tools/definitions.py). Availability at runtime depends on configuration, observation conditions, backend capabilities, and external service readiness. Models can pass `request={"kind": "help"}` to supported query tools for on-demand field documentation.
